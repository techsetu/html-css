## What is HTML

- HTML stands for _HyperText Markup Language_.
- It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
- It describes the structure of a Web page.
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.

## What is CSS

- CSS stands for _Cascading Style Sheets_.
- It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
- It describes how the web page should be displayed(UI).
- It describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
- Simply saying, CSS adds styling to the web page.

__NOTE:__ The word _Cascading_ means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent.
## Hello World

Type the following code in your editor and give the file name as `hello.html`.

__NOTE:__ It is recommended to create a folder (say `html-css-workshop`) and keep all the examples
codes in it.

~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p style="color: blue;">This is the first web page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
~~~
{: .language-html}

Open the `hello.html` file in browser. This can be done in two ways:
  - Directly go to the file through `File Explorer` and locate the folder `html-css-workshop` and right click to file `hello.html` and click on `open in browser` (see _Open With_).
  - Use the `Live Server` extension to open the file.

  __NOTE:__ Using `Live Server` to open file has benefit as the web page will be updated as we type.

>> Explain the layout of the HTML web page, `lang="en"`, `DOCTYPE`, element and tag.
